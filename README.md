PROJECT OVERVIEW:

User Input and Choice Selection:
The program starts by prompting the user to enter two numbers (num1 and num2).
Then, it displays a menu of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and asks the user to choose one.

Operation Execution:
Depending on the user's choice, the program performs the corresponding operation using functions.
It uses Python's arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division respectively.

Output:
After performing the operation, the program displays the result to the user.

Error Handling:
The program handles potential errors such as division by zero by checking the denominator before performing division.
